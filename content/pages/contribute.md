Title: Contribute

We are always looking for contributors, and want to grow the developer/contributor
base for Bokeh. The [Gitter chat channel](https://gitter.im/bokeh/bokeh) and the
[public mailing list](https://groups.google.com/a/anaconda.com/forum/?pli=1#!forum/bokeh)
are great places to get in touch with current core developers, and the
[Developer Guide](https://bokeh.pydata.org/en/latest/docs/dev_guide.html) is a great place
to get set up for developing on Bokeh. We are eager to assist and mentor new contributors.

If you are the author of an existing plotting library, or a user of another programming
language such as Julia or Swift, and would like your interfaces to generate output
that can be rendered by the
[BokehJS](https://bokeh.pydata.org/en/latest/docs/dev_guide/bokehjs.html) JavaScript runtime,
we’d love to help with those integrations.

If you have a data API or other web-based tool that you think would be great to
have available by default in Bokeh, we would be excited to make it available as
an extension for Bokeh.

If you are a JavaScript developer and want to help us make Bokeh easier to use
on the JavaScript side, and plug in more nicely with libraries like React,
please get in touch.

If you are a designer and you want to help us build out a great set of default
styles for our plots, we can definitely use your help!

And lastly, if you have built a nice plot or live visualization app with Bokeh
and want us to showcase it in our user-submitted gallery, let us know!

Specific areas we’d like to get help on:

- Mobile and touch platforms
- Maintaining Bokeh.jl and other language bindings
- Windows and IE support
- Interactive widgets
- Designs and styling
- Canvas and WebGL performance optimization
- Connectors to various data APIs (public data or even commercial software suites)
