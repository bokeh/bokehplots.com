Title: Roadmap

Since the Bokeh project's inception, many of the major goals it set out have
been accomplished, but there is still important work to continue.
In broad strokes, here are the big tasks that we are currently planning to
work on or improve as we move towards a 1.0 release.

#### Community

- Define and ratify Project Governance, transition to public meetings
- Create a mechanism to make Bokeh extensions easily sharable, discoverable, and installable

#### Core BokehJS improvements

- Migrate BokehJS codebase to [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- Increase WebGL capability and support to more areas (e.g patches)
- Support for scripted animations and visual transitions

#### Core Python library

- Add support for integrating with [Altair](//github.com/altair-viz/altair)

#### Documentation

- Complete docstring coverage for the entire Python library
- Automated reference documentation for BokehJS
- Increase the number of gallery examples

#### Testing

- Improved unit test coverage to above 95 percent
